               <p>Tomorrowland is a Belgian electronic dance music festival held in Boom, Belgium. Tomorrowland was first held in 2005. It now stretches over two weekends and usually sells out in minutes.[3]
                On March 20, 2013, ID&T Belgium and SFX Entertainment announced that it would begin organizing an American spin-off of Tomorrowland, known as TomorrowWorld.[58] The festival is held at the Bouckaert Farm in Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia, located 48 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Atlanta.[59] The site was specifically chosen due to its resemblance to the Boom location in which Tomorrowland is traditionally held.

                The inaugural edition of TomorrowWorld, held 27–29 September 2013, reused the "Book of Wisdom" design used for the main stage at Tomorrowland in 2012. The festival played host to over 140,000 attendees over the weekend. TomorrowWorld brought more than music, dancing and stunning visuals to the area that year - it brought an economic boost. Officials reported TomorrowWorld 2013 brought $85.1 million into the Georgia economy, including $70 million directly to Atlanta. That $70 million matches the impact the city got from hosting the NCAA Final Four in 2013.

                Ultra Music Festival (UMF) is an annual outdoor electronic music festival that takes place during March in Miami, Florida, United States.[1] The festival was founded in 1999 by Russell Faibisch and Alex Omes and is named after the 1997 Depeche Mode album, Ultra.[2]

                It was first held on Miami Beach, but besides a tenure at Bicentennial Park, and briefly being held at Virginia Key in 2019, it has primarily been held at Bayfront Park in downtown Miami. It was a one-day festival from 1998 to 2006.[3][4]
                
                Since 2011, Ultra has taken place across three days (Friday through Sunday) during the 
                month of March.[5] In 2012, it had a record attendance, of 155,000 people.[6] In 2013, 
                he festival took place across two consecutive weekends to celebrate its 15th anniversary, with a 
                combined attendance of 330,000 people.[7] In 2014, the festival returned to its 
                original single-weekend format, selling out pre-sale tickets in under five minutes.[8][9] 
                The city of Miami has estimated that since 2012, Ultra has "generated approximately $995 million of
                 economic impact", with $168 million in 2018 alone.[10]
                
                The festival is held alongside the Winter Music Conference—an event focusing 
                on the electronic music industry (which was acquired by Ultra outright in 2018), 
                and Miami Music Week—a larger program of electronic music concerts and parties held
                 across the region, with both events usually leading into Ultra.[11]
